# Machine-Learning-in-Business
### Project Description: 

In this data science project, we will develop a machine learning model to determine the most profitable location for a new oil well for the OilyGiant mining company. Using geological exploration data from three different regions, our goal is to predict oil reserves, select the best wells, and estimate potential profit while managing risk.

* Data Preparation – Load and explore oil well data, ensuring it is clean and ready for modeling.
* Model Training & Evaluation – Train a linear regression model to predict oil reserves and assess model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Profit Calculation – Identify the top 200 most promising wells based on predictions and estimate profitability considering operational costs.
* Risk Assessment – Apply the Bootstrapping technique (1000 simulations) to evaluate potential profit, confidence intervals, and the risk of financial loss.
* Decision Making – Select the region with the highest average profit while ensuring the risk of losses remains below 2.5%
